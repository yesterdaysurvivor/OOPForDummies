    "## Dwight's Snake Game Plan\n",
    "Dwight is focused on completing the Snake game as quickly and efficiently as possible, with the same precision and no-nonsense attitude he applies to all his projects. He chooses procedural programming because it allows him to break down the game into modular functions, each with a single, clear responsibility. This approach ensures that the code is both fast and efficient, without any unnecessary complexity or delays. Dwight believes that procedural programming will help him get the job done with maximum productivity and minimal distractions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `handle_user_input()` Capture and process user input for controlling the snake's movement, with minimal overhead.\n",
    "\n",
