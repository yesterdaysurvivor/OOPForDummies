# OOPForDummies

## Why should you care about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? 

Without OOP, codebases quickly turn into an unmanageable mess, difficult to scale, maintain, or debug. 
Ever struggled with spaghetti code, where a small change breaks everything? 
OOP solves this by structuring code into reusable, modular components using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 

In this repository, we’ll build a *Snake Game* while exploring why OOP matters. 
You'll see firsthand how OOP makes the game more maintainable, scalable, and efficient. 
By the end, you won’t just have a working game—you’ll have a deeper understanding of writing clean, structured code. 🚀

## 🚀 Installation and Running the Snake Game

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (>=3.8) → [Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Jupyter Notebook → Installed via `pip` or Anaconda
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### 📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yesterdaysurvivor/OOPForDummies.git
cd OOPForDummies
```

### 📦 Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Create and activate a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:

- Windows (CMD/PowerShell):
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- Mac/Linux (Terminal):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 📌 Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🏁 Step 4: Open the Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook with:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the `snake_game.ipynb` file.

### ✍️ Step 5: Complete the Missing Code
The notebook contains guided explanations along with empty code blocks that you'll need to fill in. These sections are marked with `# TODO: Complete this function`. Follow the descriptions to implement missing logic and understand the role of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in structuring the game.

### 🎮 Step 6: Run the Game
Once you've completed the missing sections, execute the notebook cells to see the Snake Game in action!
